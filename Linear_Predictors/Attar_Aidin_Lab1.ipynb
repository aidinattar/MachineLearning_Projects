    "The two errors are comparable ($\\sim 0.19$ vs $0.16$), in contrast with what we expected. Indeed since the the model is trained on the training set minimizing the loss function and making our model as optimized as possible. This may be caused by the smallness of the data set and an unfortunate choice of the seed: indeed repeating the procedure with different seeds brings a smaller error for the training set than the one of the test set. Furthermore the small amount of interations makes the results very unstable. However the multiple operations of randomization, not always based on the seed used, make the results different for every run. We can appreciate the error trend in the following plot:"

    "In this case, as expected, the training error is almost always smaller than the test error, indeed, as said in the previous answer, the model is trained on the training error, minimizing the loss function, so it is to be expected this behaviour.\n",
    "While the training error is significantly smaller in the case with 4000 iterations than the previous case, the test error doesn't show notewhorthy differences probabily due to the small dimension of the latter."

Honestly I can't see a reason to exclude one of the three features, maybe the feature 'tempo' seems to be the one that characterize less between classical and metal music. The error rate on test set results in this way less than the ones we obtain using combination of the other features, meaning that the algorithm, using the three features, assignes to 'tempo' a small weight."

Be careful if there are some ram eating processes active, it can lead to some freezing problems, at least for me (8Gb of RAM)."
