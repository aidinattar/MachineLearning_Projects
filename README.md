# MachineLearning_Projects
Machine Learning course A.Y. 2021/2022.

Prof. Pietro Zanuttigh

## Python_Tutorial
Basic tutorial for Python: how to input a data file, how to fit a set using sklearn.linear_model and how to display a set of data, both in 2D and 3D.

## Linear_Predictors
First Machine Learning assignment, based on a classification of music genre and prediction some house prices.

The algorithms which are used in this notebook are the following:

- perceptron, written by hand;

- logistic regression, implementation of sklearn algorithm;

- linear regression, implementation of sklearn algorithm;

- least squares, implementation of sklearn algorithm.


Mark: 1/1

## Support_Vector_Machines
Kuzushiji Classification (ancient japanese characters) with Support Vector Machines.

I used the sklearn algorithm for support vector machines and evaluated the best parameters for the problem.
Then I compared the logistic regression results with the support vector machines for this very problem.

## Neural_Network
Kuzushiji Classification (ancient japanese characters) with Neural Network, in particolar with Multi-layer Perceptron classifier.

I used the sklearn algorithm for MLP Neural Network and evaluated the best parameters for the problem.
Then I compared the logistic regression and the support vector machines results with the MLP neural network ones for this very problem.
